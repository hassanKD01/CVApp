# CVApp
A small project using .net core's razor pages and ef core  with MSSQL database.\
To run the project you can clone the repository and open the solution in visual studio and run it from there.(docker-compose from the command line will produce errors because of the [COMReference support for linux](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/3986))
